# Lets see this program where the user is asked for name and age

name = input("Enter Name: ")
age = input("Enter Age: ")

# cosidering age could be numerical as for R2D2 or C3PO 
# age on the other hand has to be purely numerical
# further lets consider a program if the age is below 5, or 5 to 12, or 12 to 15, or 15 to 20 we
# may call the user a baby, child, teenager
